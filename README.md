# Synopsis
The system behaves correctly in presence of multiple concurrent clients. Our system ensures that the reservation is identical at all servers and any update to the system is done in a mutually exclusive fashion using Lamport's algorithm. Since Lamport's algorithm requires the messages between servers are delivered in FIFO order, our implementation uses TCP protocol. We assume that all servers know the IP addresses of other servers; every server has a file that holds its IP address and port number as well as those of other servers.
